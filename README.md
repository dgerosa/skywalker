#### Things I like in Python

`skywalker` is a Python module that contains some of the things I like in Python. I was tired of copying the same snippets over and over, so I put them in a module to be imported from everywhere. `skywalker` deals with all sort of things like plotting, timing, checkpointing, etc. etc.

## Installation

    pip install skywalker
