#### Things I like in Python

`skywalker` is a Python module which contains some of the things I like in python. I was tired of copying the same snippets over and over, so I put them in a module to be imported from everywhere. `skywalker` is compatible with both python 2 and 3, and deals with all sort of things like plotting, timing, checkpointing, etc. etc.

## Installation

    pip install skywalker

## Tools

These are some of the things you can do with `skywalker` (beside using a lightsaber, of course).  A list of all functions and tools is available in the documentation.

- **checkpoint**: Smart checkpointing of function outputs to `h5` files.
- **dontprint**: Deep output suppression.
- **plot**: Handle matplotlib options, including saving to file.
- **processify**: Spawn a new process everytime that function is executed.
- **singleton**: Define that class as a singleton (one instance at any time can exist)
- **timer**: Print execution time of a function/class.
