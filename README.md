#### Things I like in Python

`skywalker` is a Python module that contains some of the things I like in Python. I was tired of copying the same snippets over and over, so I put them in a module to be imported from everywhere.

## Installation

    pip install skywalker

## Docs

The things you can do with `skywalker` (besides using a lightsaber, of course) are described at [docs.md](docs.md)
